<P>Let's now see how one can write dedicated applications. Basic notions will be
seen, along with a very simple client. Greater details are given as online
manual pages.</P>


<P>The historical test program for <EM>BrlAPI</EM> was something like:
<UL>
<LI>connect to <EM>BrlAPI</EM></LI>
<LI>get driver id</LI>
<LI>get driver name</LI>
<LI>get display size</LI>
<LI>try entering raw mode, immediately leave raw mode.</LI>
<LI>get tty control</LI>
<LI>write something on the display</LI>
<LI>wait for a key press</LI>
<LI>leave tty control</LI>
<LI>disconnect from <EM>BrlAPI</EM></LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>It is here rewritten, its working briefly explained.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1</A> <A HREF="BrlAPI.html#toc5.1">Connecting to <EM>BrlAPI</EM></A>
</H2>

<P>Connection to <EM>BrlAPI</EM> is needed first, thanks to the
<CODE>brlapi_openConnection</CODE> call. For this, a
<CODE>brlapi_connectionSettings_t</CODE> variable must be filled which will hold the
settings the library needs to connect to the server. Just giving <CODE>NULL</CODE>
will work for local use. The other parameter lets you get back the parameters
which were actually used to initialize connection. <CODE>NULL</CODE> will also be nice
for now.</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
  if (brlapi_openConnection(NULL, NULL)==BRLAPI_INVALID_FILE_DESCRIPTOR) {
    brlapi_perror("brlapi_openConnection");
    exit(1);
  }
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The connection might fail, so testing is needed.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2</A> <A HREF="BrlAPI.html#toc5.2">Getting driver name</A>
</H2>

<P>Knowing the type of the braille device might be useful:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
  char name[BRLAPI_MAXNAMELENGTH+1];
  if (brlapi_getDriverName(name, sizeof(name)) &lt; 0)
    brlapi_perror("brlapi_getDriverName");
  else
    fprintf(stderr, "Driver name: %s\n", name);
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>This is particularly useful before entering raw mode to achieve file
transfers for instance, just to check that the device is really the one
expected.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3</A> <A HREF="BrlAPI.html#toc5.3">Getting display size</A>
</H2>

<P>Before writing on the braille display, the size should be always first
checked to be sure everything will hold on it:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
  if (brlapi_getDisplaySize(&amp;x, &amp;y) &lt; 0)
    brlapi_perror("brlapi_getDisplaySize");
  else
    fprintf(stderr, "Braille display has %d line%s of %d column%s\n",
      y, y>1?"s":"", x, x>1?"s":"");
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4</A> <A HREF="BrlAPI.html#toc5.4">Entering raw mode, immediately leaving raw mode.</A>
</H2>

<P>Entering raw mode is very simple:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
  fprintf(stderr, "Trying to enter in raw mode... ");
  if (brlapi_enterRawMode(name) &lt; 0)
    brlapi_perror("brlapi_enterRawMode");
  else {
    fprintf(stderr, "Ok, leaving raw mode immediately\n");
    brlapi_leaveRawMode();
  }
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Not every driver supports raw mode, so testing is needed.</P>
<P>While in raw mode, <CODE>brlapi_sendRaw</CODE> and <CODE>brlapi_recvRaw</CODE>
can be used to send and get data directly to and from the device.
It should be used with care, improper use might completely thrash the device!</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.5">5.5</A> <A HREF="BrlAPI.html#toc5.5">Getting tty control</A>
</H2>

<P>Let's now display something on the device. control of the tty must be get
first:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
  fprintf(stderr, "Taking control of the tty... ");
  if (brlapi_enterTtyMode(BRLAPI_TTY_DEFAULT, NULL) >= 0)
  {
    fprintf(stderr, "Ok\n");
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The first parameter tells the server the number of the tty to take
control of. Setting BRLAPI_TTY_DEFAULT lets the library determine it for us.</P>

<P>The server is asked to send <EM>brltty</EM> commands, which are device-independent.</P>

<P>Getting control might fail if, for instance, another application already took
control of this tty, so testing is needed.</P>

<P>From now on, the braille display is detached from the screen.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.6">5.6</A> <A HREF="BrlAPI.html#toc5.6">Writing something on the display</A>
</H2>

<P>The application can now write things on the braille display without
altering the screen display:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
    fprintf(stderr, "Writing to braille display... ");
    if (brlapi_writeText(0, "Press a braille key to continue...") >= 0)
    {
      fprintf(stderr, "Ok\n");
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The cursor is also asked <EM>not</EM> to be shown: its position is set to 0.</P>

<P>"Writing to braille display... Ok" is now displayed on the screen, and
"Press a braille key to continue..." on the braille display.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.7">5.7</A> <A HREF="BrlAPI.html#toc5.7">Waiting for a key press</A>
</H2>

<P>To have a break for the user to be able to read these messages,
a key press (a command here, which is driver-independent) may be waited for:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
      fprintf(stderr, "Waiting until a braille key is pressed to continue... ");
      if (brlapi_readKey(1, &amp;key) > 0)
        fprintf(stderr, "got it! (code=%"BRLAPI_PRIxKEYCODE")\n", key);
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The command is returned, as described in <CODE>&lt;brlapi_constants.h></CODE>
and <CODE>&lt;brlapi_keycodes.h></CODE>.
It is not transmitted to <EM>brltty</EM>: it is up to the application to define
the behavior, here cleanly exitting, as described below.</P>
<P>The first parameter tells the lib to block until a key press is indeed read.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.8">5.8</A> <A HREF="BrlAPI.html#toc5.8">Understanding commands</A>
</H2>

<P>There are two kinds of commands: braille commands (line up/down, top/bottom,
etc.) and X Keysyms (i.e. regular keyboard keys). One way to discover which key
was pressed is to just use a switch statement: </P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
        switch(key) {
          case BRLAPI_KEY_TYPE_CMD|BRLAPI_KEY_CMD_LNUP:
            fprintf(stderr, "line up\n");
            break;
          case BRLAPI_KEY_TYPE_CMD|BRLAPI_KEY_CMD_LNDN:
            fprintf(stderr, "line down\n");
            break;
          case BRLAPI_KEY_TYPE_SYM|XK_Tab:
            fprintf(stderr, "tab\n");
            break;
          default:
            fprintf(stderr, "unknown key\n");
            break;
        }
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Another way is to ask BrlAPI to expand the keycode into separate information
parts:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
        brlapi_expandedKeyCode_t ekey;
        brlapi_expandKeyCode(key, &amp;ekey);
        fprintf(stderr, "type %u, command %u, argument %u, flags %u\n",
          ekey.type, ekey.command, ekey.argument, ekey.flags);
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Eventually, named equivalents are provided:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
        brlapi_describedKeyCode_t dkey;
        int i;

        brlapi_describeKeyCode(key, &amp;dkey);
        fprintf(stderr, "type %s, command %s, argument %u, flags",
          dkey.type, dkey.command, dkey.argument);
        for (i = 0; i &lt; dkey.flags; i++)
          fprintf(stderr, " %s", dkey.flag[i]);
        fprintf(stderr, "\n");
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>




<H2><A NAME="ss5.9">5.9</A> <A HREF="BrlAPI.html#toc5.9">Leaving tty control</A>
</H2>

<P>Let's now leave the tty:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
    fprintf(stderr, "Leaving tty... ");
    if (brlapi_leaveTtyMode() >= 0)
      fprintf(stderr, "Ok\n");
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>But control of another tty can still be get for instance, by calling
<CODE>brlapi_enterTtyMode()</CODE> again...</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.10">5.10</A> <A HREF="BrlAPI.html#toc5.10">Disconnecting from <EM>BrlAPI</EM></A>

<P>Let's disconnect from <EM>BrlAPI</EM>:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
